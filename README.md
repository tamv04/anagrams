# anagrams
ake word games, like Scrabble and
Words with Friends, that require rearranging a combination of letters to make a word.
This type of arrangement is generally referred to as an anagram, while it's known as a
permutation in mathematics. This assignment will give you some experience thinking
about and writing recursive functions. Write a C++ program that searches for
"anagrams" in a dictionary. An anagram is a word obtained by scrambling the letters of
some string. For example, the word "pot'' is an anagram of the string "otp." A sample
run of the program is given below. Your output does not have to be formatted exactly
the same as that shown in the sample, but it should be in a similar style. You can use
words.txt as your dictionary file and anagrams.cpp as an example of a main
program.
Since the purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using recursion, you
may not use any of C++'s iteration constructs (do, while, for, and goto) or any STL
algorithms (if you have no idea what this means, you're OK). In fact, similar to
homework #2, you may only use the substr() and size()/length() functions in the string
class. All repetition must be accomplished using recursion. This applies to every
operation in the program, even file operations. Obviously, you would never write a
program like this in industry but as an exercise it should be useful to gain experience
with recursion
